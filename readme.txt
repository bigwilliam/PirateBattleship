This game is not finished and still in production!!!
Comments or questions can be emailed to me: hello@bigwilliam.com

If you want to try it for what I have so far, run in your terminal: python PLAY.py

Files:
PLAY.py - interacts with the user and calls the other modules
boat.py - boat class, creates a boat object
gameboard.py - creates a board, and can be different sizes
player.py - creates a player. Just keeping it here until this game becomes multiplayer


To Do:
1. Add visual ASCII when boat is hit or  miss to make it more fun
2. validate inputs, so if user makes an invalid move it won't break
3. add feature to create boats of different sizes
4. *** put checks in place to make sure boats don't overlap!
5. BUG: some of the boats have negative coordinatesâ€¦ need to fix
6. Update board draw method so it shows coordinate headers that the user can see
